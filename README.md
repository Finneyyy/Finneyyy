### Hello There
I am an avid CTF player (I usually go by **Spectr3** or **Eoin**), and am heavily interested in Cyber Security (I even have a degree in it!).

Due to my involvement with CTF's, I can read *and understand* multiple languages (e.g: python, C, C++, java, rust, etc. etc.), but I mainly write scripts and such with python:snake:.

If you want to get in contact with me, you can put a bit of effort in and contact me via my [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/e0in), or read through previous repos of mine to find email addresses and the like
