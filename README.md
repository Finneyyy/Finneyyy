### Hi there, I'm Eoin! ðŸ‘‹
I am an avid CTF player, and am heavily interested in Cyber Security (I even have a degree in it!).

Due to my involvement with CTF's, I read multiple languages (e.g: python, C, C++, x86 assembly), but I mainly write scripts and such with python.

If you want to get in contact with me, you can put a bit of effort in and contact me via my Linkedin, or read through previous projects of mine to find email addresses and the like.
